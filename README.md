Project Overview:
This project involves building, training, and evaluating machine learning models using the popular Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, classified into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The key tasks include:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all data is on the same scale, which is essential for the performance of some models.

Model Training: Four machine learning models are trained using the processed data:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Each model is trained on 80% of the data, and predictions are made on the remaining 20%.

Performance Evaluation: After training, the models' performance is evaluated using various metrics:

Accuracy: How many predictions are correct overall.
Precision: The accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: The ability to detect all positive instances.
F1 Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two.
Additionally, a classification report for the Random Forest model is generated to provide a detailed breakdown of its performance across each class (species).

This project allows comparison between different machine learning algorithms and highlights their strengths in handling classification problems in data science.
